Key Takeaways:
-    On Unemployment there was spike as the date approached March to April, once May came around unemployment began to stablize. Compared to Covid cases and Deaths as they continued to rise.
-    Towards the beginning we noticed that the more dense a state was the more covid cases they had. This was particular for New York and gradually moved to California, however as more states began to re-open is when state political affiliation came into play. This can be seen with Texas and Florida as they where two of the first states to re-open and happened to swing red. 

Next Steps:
-    Scrub real time daily data compared to the monthly pull
-    Dive into further statistical analysis to determine potential correlations between covid rates to political affiliation
-    Look into regional areas vs. state since we were able to gather economic data that was categorized in that manner (ex. CPI, PPI, Housing Data)
